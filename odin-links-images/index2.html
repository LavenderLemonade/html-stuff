    <a href="about.html"> About</a> <!-- this basically only works because these two files are in the same directory-->

        <a href="./Contacts/contact.html"> Contact </a> <!-- this points the link towards the exact place the file is at-->
        <!-- also, by adding that ./ before the address, it's telling the code to look for a directory RELATIVE to its' own-->
